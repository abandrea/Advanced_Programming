This is a comprehensive project that involves several steps and requires a good understanding of C++, Python, numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and the use of pybind11 to create Python bindings. Let's break down the tasks and discuss each one in detail.

1. C++ Codebase
1.1. Designing the ForwardEuler Class
Objective: Create a C++ class named ForwardEuler to implement the Forward Euler method for solving ODEs.
Key Features:
Template parameter n to define the number of state variables.
Use std::array<double, n> for storing initial values.
Store the solution at each timestep in std::vector<std::array<double, n>>.
Represent the ODE as a std::function<std::array<double, n>(double, std::array<double, n>)>.
1.2. Implementing the Solver
Objective: Implement the Forward Euler method within the ForwardEuler class.
Key Steps:
Define a method to set the initial conditions.
Implement the Forward Euler integration method.
1.3. Main Function
Objective: In the main() function, define the Lotka-Volterra system and solve it using ForwardEuler.
Details:
Define the Lotka-Volterra equations as a lambda function.
Initialize the ForwardEuler solver with the given parameters.
Solve the ODE and store the results.
2. Configuration and Compilation
2.1. CMake Script
Objective: Develop a CMake script for compiling the C++ library.
Key Points:
Ensure the script locates the required dependencies.
Define the build process for the C++ code.
2.2. Compilation Instructions
Objective: Provide clear instructions for compiling the library.
Details:
Explain how to use the CMake script.
Detail any necessary steps or prerequisites.
3. Python Bindings using pybind11
3.1. Binding C++ to Python
Objective: Use pybind11 to create Python bindings for the C++ functions, classes, and methods.
Key Points:
Bind the ForwardEuler class and its methods to Python.
Ensure the interface is intuitive and adheres to Python conventions.
3.2. Python Scripts for Testing
Objective: Write Python scripts to test the C++ solver via the bindings.
Details:
Test the solver with various initial conditions and parameters.
Include a script to visualize the results (prey and predators over time).
3.3. Comparison with scipy.integrate.solve_ivp
Objective: Validate and compare the results against solve_ivp from scipy.integrate.
Details:
Compare the output of your solver with the results from solve_ivp.
Analyze any discrepancies in the solutions.
4. (Bonus) Validation and Comparison
4.1. Performance Benchmarks
Objective: Compare performance metrics between the C++ and Python implementations.
Details:
Measure execution time and accuracy.
4.2. Abstract Class for ODE Problems
Objective: Implement an abstract class ODEProblem and a subclass LotkaVolterra.
Details:
ODEProblem acts as a base for defining ODEs.
LotkaVolterra implements the specific equations and parameters for this problem.
Implementation Notes
C++ and Python Knowledge: Ensure you are comfortable with both languages and their interoperability.
Numerical Stability: Understand that the Forward Euler method has limitations, especially in terms of stability and accuracy.
Testing and Debugging: Regularly test each component to ensure correct functionality before moving on to the next step.
