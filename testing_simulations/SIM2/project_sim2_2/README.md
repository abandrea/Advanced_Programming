forward_euler.h: This file will contain the declaration of the ForwardEuler template class.

forward_euler.cpp: This file will contain the implementation of the ForwardEuler template class.

Step 2: Integrating with pybind11
bindings.cpp: This file will create the Python bindings for the ForwardEuler class using pybind11.

Step 3: Creating Documentation
README.md: This file will explain the structure of the project and how to build and run the code.

Step 4: Packaging the Project
We will ensure all source code files and documentation are included in the zip archive.

Step 5: Testing the Project
We will create a test script to verify the correctness of the implementation.

##Implementation

Step 1: Implementing the ForwardEuler class
We will start by implementing the ForwardEuler class in the forward_euler.h and forward_euler.cpp files. The class will be a template class, allowing it to work with different types of functions and initial conditions.

Step 2: Integrating with pybind11
We will create a bindings.cpp file to create the Python bindings for the ForwardEuler class using pybind11. This will allow us to use the ForwardEuler class in Python.

Please note that you will need to have pybind11 installed on your system and properly configured to compile this with your C++ toolchain. The Python package pybind11 can be installed via pip and the C++ headers need to be available to your compiler.


To demonstrate how to use the ForwardEuler class with the Lotka-Volterra equations, I create main.cpp file. This file will create an instance of the ForwardEuler class with the appropriate parameters, define the Lotka-Volterra system as a lambda function, and then solve it using our Forward Euler solver.

This main function sets up the Lotka-Volterra system and uses the ForwardEuler solver to find the solution over time, which it then prints to the console and writes to a CSV file.

Before proceeding to compile the code, you need to have a C++ compiler installed (like g++ or clang++), make and cmake for the build process, and pybind11. The pybind11 library must be installed and properly configured to work with your Python installation. The actual build commands will depend on your system and setup, but typically involve creating a CMakeLists.txt file and using CMake to generate the build system, then compiling it with make.

```bash
g++ -o main main.cpp -std=c++17
./main
```

To use this CMakeLists.txt, you will need to:
Save CMakeLists.txt file in your project's root directory.
Ensure your project's directory structure is correctly set up with the source files and header files in the appropriate locations.
Run $cmake$ to generate the build system, followed by $make$ to compile the code.

```bash
cmake .
make
``` 

After compiling the code, you should have an executable file called main in your project directory. You can run this executable to see the output of the ForwardEuler solver for the Lotka-Volterra system.


#file bash script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
