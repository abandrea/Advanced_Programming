##First Homework in Advanced Programming.

The homework assignment is about implementing a sparse matrix class in C++. It involves creating a class that efficiently stores sparse matrices, which are matrices predominantly filled with zeros.

##Project structure that i thinked to plan:

1. Framework: C++17 standard, ensuring modern language features and compatibility.

2. Project Directory Structure:

- SparseMatrixBase.h: Abstract base class declaration for sparse matrices.
- SparseMatrixCOO.h and SparseMatrixCOO.cpp: Class declaration and definition for COO format.
- SparseMatrixCSR.h and SparseMatrixCSR.cpp: Class declaration and definition for CSR format.
- main.cpp: Main program for testing and demonstrating functionality.
- Optional: Utilities.h and Utilities.cpp for additional helper functions or classes.
